# KaraCos server for node.js

## What is KaraCos ?

An application server which exposes couchdb documents in a HTTP tree.

## But KaraCos is already written in Python, why move it to javascript ?

Languages switch!

Mastering javascript, css, and html should be enough to develop a KaraCos application, even for server-side code.

## Project stage:

Early dev

## Will the python version stop:

Once features of the karacos-nodejs impl will reach sufficient level, the KaraCos python impl will stall and certainly die...
